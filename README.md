# Smart-Embedded-Agriculture-Monitoring-System
 A project to monitor the environment around a living plant by sensing the paramters that affect the well being of the plant like soil moisture, air humidity, air temperature, and light intensity.

# Features
- Detect air temperature and humidity around a plant
- Also measures the soil moisture and light intensity
- Sends a notification to a mobile phone through a telegram bot

# Hardware required
- ESP32
- DHT22 Sensor
- LDR (Light Intensity Resistor)
- Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.3
- Cables
- Mobile phone for notifications

# Notes
The arduino code is in the code folder and the hardware layout is in the hardware folder in the form of a fritzing file and requires fritzing to open it.
